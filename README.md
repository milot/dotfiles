# dotfiles
My personal customization files, these are intended to be cross-platform due to me changing computers frequently.

## Custom vim traits

* `,a` brings up [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a sidebar buffer for navigating and manipulating files
* `,t` brings up [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim), a project file filter for easily opening specific files
* `,b` restricts ctrlp.vim to open buffers
* `ds`/`cs` delete/change surrounding characters (e.g. `"Hey!"` + `ds"` = `Hey!`, `"Hey!"` + `cs"'` = `'Hey!'`) with [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* `gcc` toggles current line comment
* `gc` toggles visual selection comment lines
* `vii`/`vai` visually select *in* or *around* the cursor's indent
* `Vp`/`vp` replaces visual selection with default register *without* yanking selected text (works with any visual selection)

### Custom tmux traits

* `<C-a>` is the prefix
* mouse scroll initiates tmux scroll
* `prefix v` makes a vertical split
* `prefix s` makes a horizontal split
